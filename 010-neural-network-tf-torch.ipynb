    "\n",
    "- **Function**: `torch.tensor` is a function in PyTorch used to create a tensor. Similar to `tf.constant`, it creates a tensor with a fixed value. However, unlike TensorFlow's `tf.Tensor` created by `tf.constant`, PyTorch's tensors are mutable by default.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Used to create a tensor from data, like a list or a NumPy array.\n",

    "### 2. `torch.Tensor` (analogous to `tf.Tensor`)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class**: `torch.Tensor` is the base class for tensors in PyTorch. All tensors in PyTorch are instances of this class. Like TensorFlow's `tf.Tensor`, it represents multi-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "- **Usage**: Used as the primary data structure in PyTorch for all operations, including storing and manipulating data.\n",

Unlike regular tensors, when a `torch.nn.Parameter` is assigned as an attribute of a `torch.nn.Module`, it is automatically added to the list of the module's parameters and will be considered by optimizers.\n",
