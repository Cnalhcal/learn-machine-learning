The justification for calling \(P(y, x \mid \theta)\) likelihood rather than probability hinges on the function's role and interpretation in statistical analysis, particularly in the context of parameter estimation and inference. Here's a detailed justification:

1. **Function Role**: In the formulation \(P(y, x \mid \theta)\), the emphasis is on assessing different values of \(\theta\) based on the observed data (\(x, y\)). This contrasts with a probability distribution, where the focus is on the outcomes (data) given fixed parameters. When we talk about likelihood, we are interested in how the parameters (\(\theta\)) relate to the data we observed, not in predicting new data points.

2. **Parameter vs. Data Perspective**: Probability distributions describe the likelihood of observing various outcomes (data) given specific parameters. They are normalized so that the sum (or integral, for continuous variables) of probabilities across all possible outcomes equals one. This normalization is essential because it reflects the total certainty that some outcome will occur. In contrast, the likelihood function \(L(\theta \mid x, y) = P(y, x \mid \theta)\) treats the data (\(x, y\)) as fixed and evaluates how the parameters (\(\theta\)) might vary. This is a key distinction: likelihood is not a distribution over the data but a function that evaluates the plausibility of parameter values given the data.

3. **No Normalization Constraint**: As a function of \(\theta\), the likelihood does not need to satisfy the conditions of a probability distribution with respect to \(\theta\). It doesn't sum or integrate to one over \(\theta\). This lack of a normalization requirement allows the likelihood function to focus solely on the relative plausibility of different parameter values without being constrained by the requirements of forming a valid probability distribution over those parameters.

4. **Interpretation and Usage**: The primary use of the likelihood function is in estimation and inference, specifically through methods like Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). In MLE, we choose the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, indicating the highest plausibility of the parameters given the observed data. This interpretation as a measure of plausibility, rather than a strict probability, is crucial for understanding why certain parameter values are considered more likely or fitting to the observed data than others.

In summary, the term "likelihood" is used to emphasize the function's role in evaluating how plausible or fitting different parameter values are for the observed data, without the constraints that apply to a probability distribution. This conceptual framing is fundamental to statistical inference, where the focus shifts from predicting data outcomes to estimating and making inferences about model parameters based on observed data.
